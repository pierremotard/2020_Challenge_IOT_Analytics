# 2020 Hack Illinois Caterpillar

Caterpillar challenge of 2020 Hack Illinois.

## Mission

Caterpillar has machines that collect plenty of data points from their sensors. 
They need data science to analyze all this data and make predictions on it, as well as detecting anomalies.

## Solution

We were able to categorize the channels (sensors) and then find all correlated channels.
We also built a simple predictor to detect anomalies in data.

## Tools

We used python as main language and as machine learning libraries we used pandas, numpy and scikit.

## Challenges

The preprocessing was harder than expected, with data very unfamiliar to us that had to be converted to a usable format.
